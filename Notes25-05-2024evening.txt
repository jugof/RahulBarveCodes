Dependency Injection:
	Beans registered in the configuration unit may have
	dependencies.
	
	When client program makes a request to Spring for such beans,
	Spring has to inject values for these dependencies.
	
	This is known as Dependency Injection.
	
	It is mainly handled by 2 ways:
		1. Setter Injection:
			In this approach, Spring identifies the dependencies
			(properties) of the bean and injects values into them
			using setter methods.
			
		2. Constructor Injection:
			In this approach, Spring identifies the dependencies
			(properties) of the bean and injects values into them
			using constructors.
			
			By default, the sequence of the arguments is considered as:
			Left to Right in Java and Top to Bottom in XML.	
		
			However, it can be customized using 'index' attribute.
			
Dependency Injection for Reference Types:
	One bean may have dependency on another bean or several
	beans.
	
	When a client program makes a request for Outer Bean, Spring has
	to build inner bean, inject it into outer bean and return that.
		
	To handle this, there are 2 ways:
		1. Using 'ref' as an attribute
		2. Using '<ref>' as an element
