Configuration without XML:
	Even though XML is used as a configuration unit for
	Spring Beans, in recent years, 2nd approach is widely used:
		Annotation Based Configuration
	
	This approach enables developers to quick start the configuration.
	Allowing Rapid Application Development (RAD).
	
	Annotation Based Configuration can be implemented
	by 2 ways:
		1. Java Based Configuration
		2. Pure Annotation Based Configuration
		
	Java Based Configuration:
		In this approach, the configuration unit is specified by
		writing a Java Class.
		
		Once the class is created, it is necessary to intimate Spring
		that this class is not an ordinary class; rather it is the
		configuration unit of the application.
		
		This is done using @Configuration annotation.
		It is to be applied at the class level.
		
		Once the class is marked as Configuration Unit, it can
		be used to configure beans.
		
		This is done by defining a method that returns an
		object of the class of which the bean is to 
		be configured. 
		
		Once the method is defined, it is necessary to intimate Spring
		that this method is not an ordinary method; rather it is a
		bean configuration specific method.
		
		This is done using @Bean annotation.
		It is to be applied at the method level.
		
		By default, the bean gets configured with an ID
		which is the method name.
		
		Obtaining Beans:
			Once the beans are configured in the configuration
			unit, any time they can be obtained back.
			
			This is done using 
			AnnotationConfigApplicationContext class.
			
			AnnotationConfigApplicationContext must understand
			the configuration unit from which the beans are
			to be loaded.
			
			This is done by registration of Configuration Unit
			with AnnotationConfigApplicationContext.
			
			This is done using 'register()' method of
			AnnotationConfigApplicationContext class.
			
			Once the registration is done, to apply the
			changes, it is necessary to refresh the context.
			
			This is done using 'refresh()' method.
			
	Simplifying AnnotationConfigApplicationContext:
		To load the beans using AnnotationConfigApplicationContext,
		it is necessary to register the configuration unit with
		AnnotationConfigApplicationContext.
		
		After registration, to apply changes, it is necessary
		to refresh the context.
		
		This can be simplified in such a way that registration and
		context refreshment is done implicitly.
		
		This is possible using parameterized constructor
		of AnnotationConfigApplicationContext.
		
		It handles both these activities implicitly.
		
	Changing Bean ID:
		By default, the ID of the bean is taken as the
		name of the method on which @Bean annotation is
		applied.
		
		It can be changed by passing it as a parameter
		for @Bean annotation.
		
	Exploring More Annotations:
		To configure beans with different strategies, 
		relevant annotations have been provided.
		
		E.g.
		@Lazy is used for Lazy Loading
		@Scope is used for changing the scope to something.
		Default is singleton.
		
Bean Wiring:
	When one bean depends upon another bean, Spring has to
	resolve that dependency.
	
	Spring creates inner bean first and injects it into
	outer bean and returns that outer bean back to the
	client.
	
	This process of connecting one bean to another is called
	as Bean Wiring.
	
	Bean Wiring is of 2 types:
		1. Explicit
		2. Implicit
		
	Explicit Wiring:
		In this case, the bean to be wired with another bean
		is explicitly configured in the configuration unit.
		
	Implicit Wiring:
		In this case, instead of explicitly wiring the bean,
		Spring automatically figures it out and wires
		it.
		
		Therefore this type of wiring is also called as
		Auto Wiring.
		
		Spring provides @Autowired annotation to implement it.
		It can be applied at various levels:
			field
			setter method level
			constructor
			
		How Auto-wiring works?
		Spring identifies the type of the field on which
		@Autowired annotation is applied.
		
		Then it checks for any bean in the configuration unit
		of which type matches with that field type.
		
		Once the match is found, it wires that bean.
		
		If the bean is not found, exception is raised.
		This means, Spring mandates to have at least 1
		bean.
		
		This can be configured to make it optional
		by using 'required' attribute set to 'false'.
		
		If multiple beans are found, it results into
		exception.
		
		This can be resolved by 2 ways:
			1. Using @Primary
			2. Using @Qualifier
			
		@Primary is used in the configuration specific
		class to mark the specific bean as Primary.
		
		@Qualfier is used in the bean specific class to
		qualify the bean with the matching ID.

TODO 4:
	Create a class StockHolding with following attributes:
		holdingId (Numeric)
		stockRef (Stock)//Reliance, 8000
		stockHolderRef (StockHolder)//James
		quantity (Numeric)//50
		
	Configure 1 bean each of type Stock, StockHolder
	and StockHolding.
	
	Implement Auto-wiring.
	Use Java Based Configuration.
	
	Write a main program that loads a bean of type:
	StockHolding and prints following information:
		Name of the Holder --> James
		Name of the Stock --> Reliance
		Valuation of the Stock --> 400000
		
	You may have to add relevant method in StockHolding
	class to get these results.
	
Pure Annotation Based Configuration:
	Although Java Based Configuration can be used to
	configure beans, still developer has to configure
	them using 'new' operator.
	
	In Pure Annotation based approach, the object creation
	does not take place using 'new' operator.
	
	Rather it takes place via Java's Reflection semantics.

	In this approach, the class of which the bean is to configured
	must be declared as a Managed Component to Spring.
	
	This is possible using @Component annotation.
	It is to be applied at the class level.
	
	Once the component is declared, at any time its 
	instance can be obtained by the client program.
	
	This is done using overloaded 'getBean()' method
	which accepts a reference of type: java.lang.Class.
	
	Once the component is declared using @Component,
	the configuration unit (@Configuration) must be able
	to identify it.
	
	In order to ask Spring to identify @Component related
	classes, scanning of package is required.
	
	This phase is called as Component Scanning.
	To handle scanning, there is an annotation:
		@ComponentScan
		
	It is to be applied at the class level of the
	configuration specific class.
	
	Once @ComponentScan is used, by default it scans
	the package which is same as that of the package
	of the configuration specific class.
	
	To scan other packages, their names must be mentioned
	using 'basePackages' attribute.
	
	However, once this attribute is used, the same package
	does not get scanned automatically.
	
	It is to be scanned explicitly using its name
	in that attribute.
	
	It is also possible to obtain @Component annotated
	beans using ID by supplying it as a parameter to
	that annotation.
