Pure Annotation Based Configuration:
	Although Java Based Configuration can be used to
	configure beans, still developer has to configure
	them using 'new' operator.
	
	In Pure Annotation based approach, the object creation
	does not take place using 'new' operator.
	
	Rather it takes place via Java's Reflection semantics.

	In this approach, the class of which the bean is to configured
	must be declared as a Managed Component to Spring.
	
	This is possible using @Component annotation.
	It is to be applied at the class level.
	
	Once the component is declared, at any time its 
	instance can be obtained by the client program.
	
	This is done using overloaded 'getBean()' method
	which accepts a reference of type: java.lang.Class.
	
	Once the component is declared using @Component,
	the configuration unit (@Configuration) must be able
	to identify it.
	
	In order to ask Spring to identify @Component related
	classes, scanning of package is required.
	
	This phase is called as Component Scanning.
	To handle scanning, there is an annotation:
		@ComponentScan
		
	It is to be applied at the class level of the
	configuration specific class.
	
	Once @ComponentScan is used, by default it scans
	the package which is same as that of the package
	of the configuration specific class.
	
	To scan other packages, their names must be mentioned
	using 'basePackages' attribute.
	
	However, once this attribute is used, the same package
	does not get scanned automatically.
	
	It is to be scanned explicitly using its name
	in that attribute.
	
	It is also possible to obtain @Component annotated
	beans using ID by supplying it as a parameter to
	that annotation.
