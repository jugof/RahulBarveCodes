Associations / Relationships
	In a business domain, there are several types of
	entities. These entities might be related to each
	other.
	
	This is expressed by mapping associations.
	
	In Java, associations are of 4 types:
		1. One to One
		2. One to Many
		3. Many to One
		4. Many to Many
		
	Associations are further divided into 2 types:
		1. Unidirectional
		2. Bidirectional
		
	This means that there are total 8 types of associations;
	but in reality, there are 7.
	
	It is because One to Many Bidirectional and
	Many to One Bidirectional are same.

Unidirectional Associations:
	This includes a single direction.
	One entity holds reference to another entity but
	that 2nd entity does not hold any reference to
	1st entity.
	
	One to One Unidirectional:
		In this association, one entity holds a reference
		to another entity; but that entity does not hold
		any reference back to 1st entity.
		
		To map One-to-One association, Hibernate provides
		@OneToOne annotation.
		
	One to Many Unidirectional:
		In this association, one entity holds many references
		to another entity; but that 2nd entity does not hold
		any reference back to 1st entity.
